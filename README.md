# 🧗 The Iron-Clad Data Science Ladder

> _"If it isn't in a repo, it doesn't exist."_

This repository documents a structured, no-shortcuts journey from **Python Engineer → Data Scientist → ML Engineer → Deep Learning → NLP → Computer Vision → Robotics**. The full plan is divided into 6 coding phases, each building directly on the last, and each ending with a real capstone project.

## 📋 The Daily Operating System (3–5 Hours/Day)

Every study day follows the same structure to fight the memory leak problem:

| Hour                             | Activity                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hour 1** — The Intake          | Theory only. Watch videos / read docs. Hard stop at 1 hour.                                     |
| **Hours 2–3** — The Lab          | Write the code from scratch, without looking at the tutorial. If you peek, you reset the timer. |
| **Hour 4** — The Integration     | Add what you learned today to yesterday's project. Keep building.                               |
| **Hour 5** — Review _(optional)_ | Debugging and git commits. No code stays on your PC overnight.                                  |

## 🗺️ Full Learning Roadmap

### 🏗️ Phase 0 — The Python Engineer _(Weeks 1–4)_

**Goal:** Stop writing "Scripting Python" and start writing "Software Python." Data science pipelines are complex software systems.

| Topic                           | The Real Task                                                                                   | Retention Check                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Git**                      | Create a repo. Learn `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`.                                           | Rule: No code stays on your PC overnight. Push everything.     |
| **2. Modular Python & Logging** | Create a `logger.py` module. Import it into a main script.                                      | Stop using `print()`. Use `logging.info()`.                    |
| **3. OOP & Exceptions**         | Create a `DataHandler` class. It must ingest a CSV and crash gracefully if the file is missing. | If your code crashes with a raw traceback, you fail. Catch it. |
| **4. SQLite & Persistence**     | Save your processed data to `data.db` via your class methods.                                   | Write a query to fetch the last 5 entries.                     |

🔥 **Capstone 1 — The "Life Logger" CLI**

> A terminal app to track your 3–5 hours of study.
>
> - **Input:** `python run.py --add "Studied Pandas" --hours 3`
> - **Logic:** A `StudySession` class validates input (no negative hours)
> - **Storage:** Saves to SQLite
> - **Output:** `logging` writes "Session saved" to `app.log`
> - **Git:** Push it.

| **6. Pandas Core**         | Load a messy dataset. Fix dates, handle NaNs, filter rows.                   | Do it without opening the CSV in Excel.  |
| **7. EDA & Viz (Seaborn)** | Plot distributions. Find outliers. Write a paragraph explaining WHY.         | A chart without a conclusion is useless. |

🔥 **Capstone 2 — The "Automated Analyst"**

> A script that takes ANY raw CSV and generates a full report.
>
> - **Ingest:** `pd.read_csv()` on a generic file
> - **Clean:** Auto-fill missing values with column mean (using OOP skills from Phase 0)
> - **Visual:** Generate a `.png` histogram for every numeric column
> - **Stats:** Log the "Skewness" of every column to a file

🔥 **Capstone 3 — The "Streamlit Predictor"**

> Your first web app.
>
> - **Model:** Train an XGBoost model on the Titanic or Heart Disease dataset

## ⚠️ The "Senior Dev" Retention Protocols

> These rules apply to **every single day** of the journey:

1. **The 20-Minute Rule** — Stuck? Debug for 20 minutes. Read the error. Print the variables. _Then_ ask AI.
2. **Spiral Learning** — Every project must use a **database** (Phase 0 skill) and a **visualization** (Phase 1 skill). Never drop the basics.
3. **Code Reviews** — Once a week, ask ChatGPT: _"Roast my code. Tell me why it is not production ready."_ Then fix it.

## 🕐 The Real Purpose of the Day-by-Day Structure

> _"The labels are a map, not a treadmill."_

Here's something important to understand about how this journey is structured:

**The day-by-day breakdown isn't meant to pressure you into finishing exact topics on exact days.** It's a framework to help you see where you are and where you're going. The "Day 1", "Day 2" labels exist for one reason — to differentiate stages of learning and show clear progression over time. They are milestones, not deadlines.

### What this means in practice:

- 📌 **You don't have to finish Day 5 on the fifth day.** If Day 3 takes you 4 days to really internalize — that's fine. Stay there until it clicks.
- 📌 **There is no falling behind.** There is only the work you've done and the work left to do. The only failure is stopping entirely.
- 📌 **Slow progress is still progress.** A concept you genuinely understand after 3 days is worth more than 5 concepts you half-learned in a rush.

### The one rule that doesn't bend:

**Be consistent. Show up every single day** — even if it's just for 30 minutes of review. The daily time commitment mentioned at the start of this plan (3–5 hours/day) is your target, and maintaining that rhythm is what separates people who finish from people who don't. The schedule is forgiving on pace, but unforgiving on consistency.

> Think of it like building a wall. It doesn't matter if you lay 10 bricks one day and 20 the next. What matters is that you never miss a day. Skip days, and the cement cracks.
