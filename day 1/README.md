# Day 1: Python Basics and Warmup

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 1 of the AI Learning Journey. The focus was on getting comfortable with Python syntax and basic programming concepts.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Variables and Data Types**: Working with strings and integers.
- **f-Strings**: Formatting strings to include variable values.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling simple functions like `square`.
- **Lists**: Creating and iterating through lists of numbers.
- **Loops**: Using `for` loops to process list elements.
- **Conditionals**: Using `if` statements to filter data (e.g., finding even numbers).

## Code Files

- `day1_warmup.py`: Contains examples of variables, specific print statements, a squaring function, and logic to filter even numbers from a list.
