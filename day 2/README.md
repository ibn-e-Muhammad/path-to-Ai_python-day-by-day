# Day 2: Algorithms and Logic

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 2, focusing on implementing basic algorithms and logic problems.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Finding Maximum**: Logic to find the largest number in a list without using built-in functions.
- **Counting**: Iterating through a list to count elements matching specific criteria (e.g., odd numbers).
- **String Manipulation**: Reversing a string manually.
- **FizzBuzz**: Implementing the classic FizzBuzz interview question using modulo operators.
- **Accumulation**: Summing up numbers based on conditions (e.g., sum of evens).
- **Filtering**: Creating new lists based on string properties (e.g., strings starting with vowels).

## Code Files

- `day2.py`: Solutions for `find_max`, `count_odds`, `reverse_str`, `fizzbuzz`, `sum_of_evens`, and `vowel_str`.
