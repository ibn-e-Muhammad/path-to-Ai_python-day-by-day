# Day 3: Data Structures and Logic

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 3, dealing with more advanced list operations, dictionaries, and logic problems.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **List Slicing**: Experimenting with advanced slicing techniques (reversing, steps, sub-lists).
- **Dictionaries**: Creating and accessing dictionary keys, values, and items.
- **List Transformation**: Modifying lists in place (e.g., squaring all elements).
- **String Processing**: Counting words that start with vowels.
- **Frequency Counter**: Manually calculating the frequency of words in a list using nested loops and dictionaries.
- **Advanced Logic**: finding the second largest number in a list.

## Code Files

- `day3.py`: Solutions for `middle`, `squares`, `count_vowel_words`, `freq`, and `sec_lar`, along with slicing examples.
