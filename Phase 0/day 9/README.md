# Day 9: Classes and Logging

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 9, marking the transition to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and professional logging practices.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Classes and Objects**: Defining blueprints (`DataProcessor`, `TextCleaner`) and creating instances.
  - **Constructors**: Using `__init__` to initialize object state.
  - **Methods**: Encapsulating logic within class functions.
- **Logging**:
  - Replacing `print` statements with the `logging` module.
  - Configuring log levels (INFO, ERROR), formats, and file outputs (`app.log`).
- **Refactoring**: Converting previously functional code into class methods.
- **List Comprehensions**: Writing concise loops for data cleaning.

## Code Files

- `day9_processors.py`: Contains the `DataProcessor` class for number analysis.
- `day9_cleaners.py`: Contains the `TextCleaner` class for string manipulation.
- `day9_main.py`: The main script setting up logging and creating object instances.
