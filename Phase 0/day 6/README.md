# Day 6: Advanced Logic and Recursion

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 6, focusing on more complex algorithms, including recursion and deep data processing.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Complex List Processing**: Calculating averages for a list of dictionaries, handling cases with no data.
- **Error Handling**: Using `try-except` to manage `ZeroDivisionError` when calculating averages.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Algorithms to find the most frequent word in a list.
- **Recursion**: Implementing a `deep_flatten` function to flatten nested lists of arbitrary depth.
- **Set Operations**: Using `set` to find unique values and logical operations to find the second largest unique number.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing specific special characters from strings using `strip` with arguments.
- **Character Frequency**: Counting the occurrence of each character in a block of text, ignoring case and whitespace.

## Code Files

- `day6.py`: Solutions for `student_averages`, `most_frequent`, `deep_flatten`, `second_largest_unique`, `clean_names`, and `char_freq`.
