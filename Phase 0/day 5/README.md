# Day 5: Modules and Nested Structures

## Overview

This folder contains the code for Day 5, introducing modular programming, error handling, and working with nested data structures.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Modules and Imports**: Creating a separate utility module (`day5_utils.py`) and importing functions into a main script (`day5_main.py`).
- **Nested Lists**: Flattening lists of lists and processing elements within nested structures.
- **List of Dictionaries**: Extracting specific data (e.g., names) from a list of dictionary objects.
- **Dictionary Filtering**: Creating a new list based on values in a dictionary (e.g., finding top scorers).
- **Error Handling**: Using `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like division by zero (`ZeroDivisionError`) or invalid conversions (`ValueError`).
- **String Formatting**: specialized string manipulation and formatting for user output.

## Code Files

- `day5.py`: Logic for flattening lists, counting evens in sublists, and dictionary processing.
- `day5_utils.py`: A collection of reusable helper functions.
- `day5_main.py`: The entry point script that uses the utility functions.
